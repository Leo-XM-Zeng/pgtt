Version 2.2 - Nov 08 2020

This release is a port of the extension for PostgreSQL v12 and v13.
Works now on all PostgreSQL version from v9.5 to current. It also
fixes automatic creation of the underlying temporary table after a
rollback.

Other fixes:

  - Fix regression test for all supported PG version.
  - Replace call to \d in regression tests, they do not report the
    same information following PG version.
  - Remove test about partitioning as it returns a failure for PG < 10.
  - Update regression tests to avoid failure related to temp table id.
  - Add regression test for error on rollback issue.


Version 2.1 - May 11 2020

This is a maintenance release to complete the work on the extension
and fix some issues.
 
  * Prevent use of foreign keys with GTT, not that PostgreSQL do not
    allow it but just to mimic the behavior of Oracle and other RDBMS
    like DB2, SQL Server and MySQL for example.
  * Raise an error on an attempt to partition a Global Temporary Table.
    This is not supported, again not because PostgreSQL do not allow
    partition on temporary table but because other RDBMS like Oracle,
    DB2 and MySQL do not support it.
  * Add support to comments, constraints and identity columns clauses
    when creating the GTT.

Other fixes:

  - Add regression tests on partitioning and FK.
  - Exclude regression.* files from git scope.
  - Improve documentation and add information about constraints.
  - Add documentation about unsupported FK and partition on GTT.
  - Fix missing files for expected test results.
  - Fix exclusion of .out and results directory.
  - Update regression tests about changes on CREATE TABLE ... LIKE.
  - Fix some typo in documentation and  markdown titles.
